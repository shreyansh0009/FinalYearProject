<h1>Decentralized Automated Document Verification System</h1></br>
This repository contains the source code for a decentralized application (dApp) designed to combat document and identity fraud. The system provides a trustless, automated, and tamper-proof method for verifying the authenticity of official documents, leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent verification ecosystem.
</br>
</br>
<h1>üöÄ Project Overview</h1>
The project addresses the pervasive issue of document fraud and the inefficiencies of manual verification processes. By combining the power of the MERN stack for a robust user interface and the immutability of the Ethereum blockchain, this system empowers individuals and organizations with a reliable and secure way to manage and verify digital credentials.The project addresses the pervasive issue of document fraud and the inefficiencies of manual verification processes.
